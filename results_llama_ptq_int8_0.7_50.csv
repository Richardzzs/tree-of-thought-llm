I'll provide the full problem and a possible next step for you to check.

## Step 1: Problem Goal
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$?

## Step 2: Current State
We need to rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form.

## Step 3: Possible next step
Subtract 10 from both sides of the inequality to get $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$.

## Step 4: Current State
Now we can factor the quadratic expression.

## Step 5: Possible next step
The quadratic expression can be factored as $(x-7)(x+2) \le 0$.

## Step 6: Current State
To solve this inequality, we need to find the intervals where the expression $(x-7)(x+2)$ is less than or equal to zero.

## Step 7: Possible next step
The solution set is the interval where one factor is negative and the other factor is positive, or both are zero."

Problem Goal:
The product of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $n!$ (n factorial). What is the value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 100?


$n!$ is divisible by 100 if $n!$ is divisible by both 4 and 25. The smallest $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 4 is 4, and the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 25 is 5.

## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 100.
## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the properties of factorials and divisibility.
## Step 3:  The first step is to identify the prime factors of 100, which are 2 and 5. We need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5.
## Step 4:  We know that $4!$ is divisible by 4 because it contains two factors of 2. Therefore, the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 4 is 4.
## Step 5:  Next, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 25. Since $25 = 5^2$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least two factors of 5.
## Step 6:  We observe that $5!$ contains two factors of 5, and"

Problem Goal:
If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a^2-b^2=100$ and $a^2+b^2=196$, what is the value of $a-b$?


Given $a^2-b^2=100$ and $a^2+b^2=196$, we can factor the left-hand side of the first equation as $(a+b)(a-b)=100$, and the left-hand side of the second equation as $(a+b)(a-b)=196$.
## Step 1:  From the given equations, we can see that $(a+b)(a-b)$ is a common factor in both equations.
## Step 2:  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $(a+b)$ and $(a-b)$ must be positive integers as well.
## Step 3:  Looking at the equation $(a+b)(a-b)=100$, we can try different factor pairs of 100 to find a solution that satisfies both equations.
## Step 4:  One factor pair of 100 that works is $(a+b)=10$ and $(a-b)=10$.
## Step 5:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=10$ and $(a-b)=10$, we find that $a=10$ and $b=0$.
## Step 6:  However, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=10$ and $b=0$ is not valid.
## Step 7:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$.
## Step 8:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$, we find that $a=12.5$ and $b=7.5$.
## Step 9:  Again, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=12.5$ and $b=7.5$ is not valid.
## Step 10:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=5$ and $(a-b)=20$.
## Step 11:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=5$ and $(a-b)=20$, we find that $a=12.5$ and $b=-12.5$.
## Step 12:  Again, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=12.5$ and $b=-12.5$ is not valid.
## Step 13:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$.

Problem Goal:
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$. What is the measure of each angle in a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5?


We will use the law of cosines to find the angles.

## Step 1: Find the largest angle using the law of cosines
Using the law of cosines, we get $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)$. Let's assume the largest side is the hypotenuse, so we'll use $a=3$, $b=4$, and $c=5$ to find the largest angle $C$. Solving for $C$, we have $\cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}$.

## Step 2: Calculate the value of angle C
Plugging the values into the formula, we get $\cos(C) = \frac{3^2 + 4^2 - 5^2}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4} = \frac{9 + 16 - 25}{24} = 0$. The value of angle C is $\cos^{-1}(0) = 90^\circ$.

## Step 3: Find the other two angles
Since we know one angle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$ to find the other two angles. Let's denote the other two angles as A and B. We have $A + B + 90 = 180$, so $A + B = 90$.

## Step 4: Use the law of cosines to find the other two angles
We can use the law of cosines again to find the other two angles. For example, we can use $a=3$, $b=5$, and $c=4$ to find angle A. Solving for A, we have $\cos(A) = \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}$.

Since 27 = 3^3 and 9 = 3^2, we can rewrite the equation as (3^2)^(18n) = (3^3)^(24).

## Step 3: Simplify the equation further by applying the power rule
Using the power rule, we can rewrite the equation as 3^(36n) = 3^(72).

## Step 4: Equate the exponents
Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents, resulting in 36n = 72.

## Step 3: Find the value that makes the denominator zero
To find the value that makes the denominator zero, we set $2y+1=0$ and solve for $y$. This gives us $y=-\frac{1}{2}$.

Problem Goal:
Suppose that $f$ is an invertible function from $(-\infty,\infty)$ to $(-\infty,\infty)$.  If $f(f(x))=x$, find $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)$.


We can substitute $f(x)$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to get $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.

## Step 3: Let's consider the given expression $x_{n} = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(...f^{-1}(x)...f^{-n}(...x)...))$, where $x$ is repeated $n$ times.
Given the expression $x_{n} = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(...f^{-1}(x)...f^{-n}(...x)...))$, where $x$ is repeated $n$ times, we can see that this expression is a composition of $f^{-1}$ with itself $n$ times.

## Step 4: We can simplify the expression $x_{n}$ by realizing that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.
Since $f(f(x)) = x$, we can simplify the expression $x_{n}$ by realizing that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) = x$. This means that $x_{n}$ is equivalent to $x$.

## Step 5: Now, we can substitute $x_{n} = x$ into the equation $y = f(x_{n})$.
Substituting $x_{n} = x$ into the equation $y = f(x_{n})$, we get $y = f(x)$.

## Step 6: Given that $f(f(x)) = x$, we can conclude that $f(x) = x + 1$.
Since $f(f(x)) = x$, we can conclude that $f(x) = x + 1$.

## Step 7: Now, we can find the value of $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n})$.
Using the fact that $x_{n} = x$ and $f(x) = x + 1$, we can find the value of $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n})$. Since $f(x) = x + 1$, we have $f(x_{n}) = x_{n} + 1$. Also, $f^{-1}(x) = x - 1$. Therefore, $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n}) = (x_{n} + 1) - (x_{n} - 1) = 2$.

### Problem Goal:
What is the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6?


To find the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6, we can complete the square or use calculus. Here, we'll use calculus.

## Step 1: Find the derivative of f(x)
To find the minimum value of the function, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. The derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6 is f'(x) = 2x + 2.

## Step 2: Set the derivative equal to zero
To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero: 2x + 2 = 0.

## Step 3: Solve for x
Solving the equation 2x + 2 = 0 gives x = -1.

## Step 4: Check if x = -1 is a minimum
To verify that x = -1 is a minimum, we can take the second derivative of f(x). The second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = 2, which is positive for all x. This confirms that x = -1 is a minimum.

## Step 5: Determine the minimum value of f(x)
Substitute x = -1 into f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 6 to find the minimum value of the function: f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 6 = 1 - 2 - 6 = -7.

## Step 6: Since we found the value of x that minimizes the function, our final answer is x = -1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-1}$"

So, $9^{18n}=27^{24}$ becomes $3^{36n}=3^{72}$.
Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $36n=72$.

Problem Goal:
What is the value of $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}}$?

To evaluate this expression, we will use the property $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$.

## Step 1: Apply the property
Using the property, we have $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}} = \frac{3^{\frac{7}{2}}}{5^{\frac{7}{2}}}$.

## Step 2: Simplify the exponent
We can simplify the exponent by breaking it down into two fractions: $\frac{7}{2} = \frac{4}{2} + \frac{3}{2}$. This gives $\frac{3^{\frac{7}{2}}}{5^{\frac{7}{2}}} = \frac{3^4 \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{2}}}{5^4 \cdot 5^{\frac{3}{2}}}$.

## Step 3: Simplify the expression
Now we can simplify the expression: $\frac{3^4 \cdot 3^{\frac{3}{2}}}{5^4 \cdot 5^{\frac{3}{2}}} = \frac{81 \cdot \sqrt{27}}{625 \cdot \sqrt{125}}$.

## Step 4: Simplify the radicals
We can simplify the radicals: $\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 3} = 3\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{125} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 5} = 5\sqrt{5}$.

## Step 5: Substitute the simplified radicals
Substituting the simplified radicals, we have $\frac{81 \cdot 3\sqrt{3}}{625 \cdot 5\sqrt{5}}$.

## Step 6: Simplify the fraction
Now we can simplify the fraction: $\frac{81 \cdot 3\sqrt{3}}{625 \cdot 5\sqrt{5}} = \frac{243\sqrt{3}}{3125\sqrt{5}}$.

The current state is ""$f^{-1}(4)$ is $\boxed{7}$.""

## Step 2: Recall the definition of the inverse function
The inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ is a function that ""reverses"" the original function $f(x)$. This means that $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

## Step 3: Use the definition of the inverse function to find $f^{-1}(3)$
