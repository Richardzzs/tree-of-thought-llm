## Step 1: Identify the problem goal and current state.
The problem goal is to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 180 and find the value of x. The current state is that the equation is 2x + 5 = 180.

## Step 2: Determine the next step based on the current state.
Since the current state is an equation, the next step is to perform an operation that will help isolate the variable x. In this case, subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation will move the constant term to the other side, isolating the term with the variable.

## Step 3: Propose the next step to solve the problem.

Problem Goal:
Find the value of $x$ such that $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+1} = 1$.


We have $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+1} = 1$. Multiplying both sides by $x(x+1)$, we get
$$(x+1) + x = x^2 + x,$$which simplifies to $$x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0.$$ This is a quadratic equation in $x$, which we can solve using the quadratic formula. We have \begin{align*}

I'll stop here, but I can continue if you'd like. 

## Step 1: Understand the format and the problem
The format requires breaking down a problem into steps, with each step being a possible next step to solve the problem from the current state. If the current state solves the problem, the step simply reiterates the current state value.

## Step 2: Analyze the first problem
The first problem is to find the positive difference between 120% of 30 and 130% of 20. The current state is given as 36 and 26, which are the results of 120% of 30 and 130% of 20, respectively.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference
The difference between 36 and 26 is calculated as 36 - 26 = 10.

## Step 4: Analyze the second problem
The second problem is to find the possible values of m such that 2x^2 + mx + 8 has two distinct real roots. The current state is given as |m| > 8.

27,2,"The expression $\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$ can be rewritten as $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}=2$ by multiplying both sides by $(a-2b)$.

## Step 1: Identify the problem goal and the current state.
The problem goal is to find the simplified numerical value of $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}$ if $\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$. The current state is that the expression $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}=2$.

## Step 2: Analyze the given information and identify the relationship between the expressions.
The expression $\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$ can be rewritten as $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}=2$ by multiplying both sides by $(a-2b)$.

## Step 3: Determine the next step to solve the problem.
The next step is to verify if the current state indeed solves the problem goal.

## Step 4: Verify if the current state solves the problem goal.
Since $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}=2$ is given as the current state, we can conclude that it indeed solves the problem goal.

P is the set of all polynomials with real coefficients and degree less than 5, and Q is the set of all polynomials with real coefficients and degree less than 3.

## Step 2:  To find the number of elements in the set $P \cup Q$, we need to consider the possible degrees of polynomials that belong to P and Q.
Polynomials in P can have degrees from 0 to 4, and polynomials in Q can have degrees from 0 to 2.

## Step 1: Problem Goal
I choose a random integer $n$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive. What is the probability that for the $n$ I chose, there exist no real solutions to the equation $x(x+5) = -n$?

## Step 2: Current State
We will count the values of $n$ that satisfy the condition $0 < n < 5$ to determine the number of values of $n$ for which there are no real solutions to the equation.

## Step 3: Count the values of $n$ with real solutions
There are 4 integers between 1 and 10 inclusive that satisfy the condition $0 < n < 5$, which are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability
The probability that for the $n$ I chose, there exist no real solutions to the equation is the number of values of $n$ for which there are no real solutions divided by the total number of possible values of $n$. The number of values of $n$ for which there are no real solutions is 10 - 4 = 6, and the total number of possible values of $n$ is 10.
