Problem Goal:
What is the sum"
1,10,"The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.
###
Since the current state provides the solution to the problem, the next step is simply to reiterate the current state value.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
2,i,"After simplifying the equation,
\[x^2 - 4 = (x + 5)(x - 2)\]
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
\[x^2 - 4 = x^2 + 3x - 10\]
### Note: The response format you requested is typically used for mathematical problems with a numerical solution. The problem presented is an algebraic equation, so the solution will involve algebraic expressions rather than a single numerical value. However, I can adapt the response format to accommodate the request as closely as possible. Here is the revised response:

## Step 1: Multiply both sides by (x-2) to clear the fraction
This step is necessary to simplify the equation and eliminate the fraction.

## Step 2: Simplify the equation
After multiplying both sides by (x-2), we get x^2"
3,4,Since the problem states that it is a triangle
4,402,"To find the derivative, apply the power rule to each term: f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5.
### Note: The boxed notation is used to indicate the final answer. Please remove the notation before using this response in a final answer. 

## Step 1: Understand the problem goal and the current state.
The problem goal is to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 1, and the current state is the function itself.

## Step 2: Propose a next step to solve the problem.
To solve the problem, we need to apply the power rule of differentiation to each term in the function.

## Step 3: Apply the power rule of differentiation.
The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1). We will apply this rule to each term in the function.

## Step 4: Differentiate the first term.
The derivative of x^3 is 3x^(3-1)"
