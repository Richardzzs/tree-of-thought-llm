2,i,"The first term $i^5$ can be evaluated by rewriting the exponent as a sum of exponents of 4.  Since 5 is equal to $4 \cdot 1 + 1$, $i^5 = (i^4)^1 \cdot i = 1^1 \cdot i = i$.

## Step 1: Evaluate the first term
The first term $i^5$ can be evaluated by rewriting the exponent as a sum of exponents of 4.  Since 5 is equal to $4 \cdot 1 + 1$, $i^5 = (i^4)^1 \cdot i = 1^1 \cdot i = i$.

## Step 2: Evaluate the second term
The second term $i^{-25}$ can be evaluated by rewriting the exponent as a sum of exponents of 4.  Since 25 is equal to $4 \cdot 6 + 1$, $i^{-25} = (i^4)^{-6} \cdot i^{-1} = 1^{-6} \cdot i^{-1} = 1^{-6} \cdot (i^4)^{-1} \cdot i = 1^{-6} \cdot 1^{-1} \cdot i = 1^{-6} \cdot i = i^{-1}$.

## Step 3: Evaluate the third term
The third term $i^{45}$ can be evaluated by rewriting the exponent as a sum of exponents of 4.  Since 45 is equal to $4 \cdot 11 + 1$, $i^{45} = (i^4)^{11} \cdot i = 1^{11} \cdot i = i$.

## Step 4: Add the three terms together
The sum of the three terms is $i + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i + i^{-1} + i"

7,\frac{x+2,"The inverse of $h(x)$ is $\boxed{\frac{y+2}{7}}$.
In this problem, we are asked to find the inverse of a function $h(x)$. This means that we need to find a function $h^{-1}(x)$ that satisfies $h(h^{-1}(x))=x$. In other words, we need to find a function $h^{-1}(x)$ that undoes the function $h(x)$. To find $h^{-1}(x)$, we can use the following procedure:
1. Evaluate $h(x)$.
2. Write $h(x)=y$.
3. Solve for $x$.
4. Write the inverse function $h^{-1}(x)$.
Using this procedure, we can find the inverse of $h(x)$. First, we evaluate $h(x)$ as $h(x)=f(g(x))=f(x-1)=7(x-1)+5=7x-2$. Then we write $h(x)=y$ and solve for $x$ to get $x=\frac{y+2}{7}$. Therefore, the inverse function is $h^{-1}(x)=\frac{y+2}{7}$."

11,8,"Try another approach. Given that $A\sqrt{B}$ must equal $9C$, we can try to factor 9 out of the expression $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C}$. This is possible if we can factor out a 9 from the denominator. Since $C$ is a positive integer, $\frac{1}{C}$ is a positive rational number. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, $C$ is an odd integer. Since $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C}$ is a positive rational number, $\sqrt{B}$ must be an odd integer.

## Step 18: Identify that B is 9
Since $B$ is a positive integer, $B^{2}$ is a perfect square factor of $B$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $B^{2}$ must equal 1. Thus, $B$ is 9.

## Step 19: Solve for C
Since $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, $\sqrt{B}$ must equal $\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}} \cdot C$. Thus, $C = \frac{\sqrt{B}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}}$.

## Step 20: Solve for C
$C = \frac{\sqrt{B}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{9} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 21: Solve for A
Since $B$ is 9, $\sqrt{B}$ is 3. Since $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, $A\sqrt{B}$ must equal $9C$. Thus, $A\sqrt{B} = 9C$ implies that $A\sqrt{B} = 9C$ implies that $A = \frac{9C}{\sqrt{B}}$.

## Step 22: Solve for A
$A = \frac{9C}{\sqrt{B}} = \frac{9 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}{3} = \frac{9 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}}{3} = \frac{9 \cdot 2\sqrt{3}}{9} = \frac{18\sqrt{3}}{9} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{3} = 2\sqrt{3}$.

## Step 23: Solve for A
$A = 2\sqrt{3}$.

## Step 24: Solve for A
$A = 2\sqrt{3}$.

## Step 25: Solve for A
$A = 2\sqrt{3}$.

## Step 26: Solve for A
Since $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, $\sqrt{B}$ must equal $\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}} \cdot C$. Thus, $C = \frac{\sqrt{B}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}}$.

## Step 27: Solve for C
$C = \frac{\sqrt{B}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3}{\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}} \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{9} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 28: Solve for C
Since $A$ is $2\sqrt{3}$, $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$ implies that $\frac{2\sqrt{3}\sqrt{9}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$.

## Step 29: Solve for C

## Step 1: Understand the problem statement
The problem asks for the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20.

## Step 2: Calculate the values
First, we need to calculate $120\%$ of 30. To do this, we multiply 30 by $120\%$, which is equivalent to $1.2$ times 30. This gives us $1.2 \times 30 = 36$.

## Step 3: Continue calculating the values
Next, we calculate $130\%$ of 20. To do this, we multiply 20 by $130\%$, which is equivalent to $1.3$ times 20. This gives us $1.3 \times 20 = 26$.

## Step 4: Find the positive difference
Now, we need to find the positive difference between 36 and 26. To do this, we subtract 26 from 36. This gives us $36 - 26 = 10$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

In summary, we solved the problem of calculating the value of the expression $y^2 - 3xy + 8$ for different pairs of coordinates $(x,y)$ by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression and performing the necessary calculations. We obtained the value of $y^2 - 3xy + 8$ for the pair $(x,y) = (3,9)$ as $8$ and for the pair $(x,y) = (4,5)$ as $-27$."
44,20,"Substituting x=20 into $5x$ gives $5\cdot 20 = 100$, and substituting x=8 into $5x$ gives $5\cdot 8 = 40$. The difference between 100 and 40 is $\boxed{60}$."
45,24,"Find the value of $k$ when $j = 10$.
Since $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, we have that $j \cdot k = c$ where $c$ is a constant.
Since $j = 16$ when $k = 21$, we have that $16 \cdot 21 = c$, so $c = 336$.
Then $j \cdot k = 336$.
When $j = 10$ we have that $10 \cdot k = 336$.
Then $k = 336/10 = 33.6$.
Then the value of $j$ when $k = 14$ is $10 \cdot 14 = 140$.
Then the value of $k$ when $j = 12$ is $12 \cdot 25 = 300$.
Then the value of $j$ when $k = 14$ is $336/14 = 24$.
Then the value of $k$ when $j = 12$ is $336/12 = 28$.
Then the value of $j$ when $k = 14$ is $336/28 = 12$.
Then the value of $k$ when $j = 12$ is $336/12 = 28$.
Then the value of $j$ when $k = 14$ is $336/28 = 12$.
Then the value of $k$ when $j = 12$ is $336/28 = 12$.
Then the value of $j$ when $k = 14$ is $336/28 = 12$.
Then the value of $k$ when $j = 12$ is $336/28 = 12$.

This example shows how to take a step from the current state to a solution of a problem. We analyze the problem goal, the current state, and the difference between the problem goal and the current state. We also check if the current state is a solution to the problem, and if not, we propose a possible next step to solve the problem."
