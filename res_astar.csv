Note: The current state is not a numerical solution to the problem, but rather a step in the process of solving the problem. The next step should be a logical next step in the process of solving the problem. 

## Step 1: Evaluate the powers of i
We know that $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, and $i^5=i^4\cdot i = -1\cdot i = -i$. We also know that $i^{-25}=i^{-(24+1)}=i^{-24}\cdot i^{-1}=\frac{1}{i}$. Since $\frac{1}{i}=\frac{i}{i^2}=\frac{i}{-1}=-i$, we have $i^{-25}=-i$. Furthermore, $i^{45}=i^{4\cdot11+1}=i^1=i$.

## Step 2: Substitute the values of i into the expression
We can now substitute the values of $i^5$, $i^{-25}$, and $i^{45}$ into the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$. This gives us $-i+(-i)+i=-i-i+i=-2i+i=-i$.

## Step"
3,4,"We have that $2^8=256$ and $4^x=2^{2x}$. Setting these equal to each other gives us $256=2^{2x}$. Since $256=2^8$, we have that $2^8=2^{2x}$. Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents to get $8=2x$. Finally, solving for $x$ gives us $x=\frac{8}{2}=\boxed{4}$.

Problem Goal:
For what values of x is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.


## Step 1: Rearrange the inequality to bring all terms to one side
The given inequality is $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$. To solve this inequality, we need to bring all terms to one side, which results in $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$.

## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression
We can factor the quadratic expression $x^2 - 5x - 14$ into $(x - 7)(x + 2)$.

## Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x
To find the values of x that satisfy the inequality, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. This results in $x - 7 = 0$ and $x + 2 = 0$, which gives us $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem describes a snail that climbs 3 feet up a 20-foot well each day but slips back 2 feet at night. We need to find out how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well.

## Step 2: Calculate the daily progress
Each day, the snail effectively moves 3 - 2 = 1 foot up the well.

## Step 3: Determine the number of days needed
Since the snail needs to climb 20 feet, and it effectively moves 1 foot per day, we can calculate the number of days needed by dividing 20 by 1.

## Step 4: Account for the final climb
After 18 days, the snail will be at 18 feet, and on the 19th day, it will climb to 19 feet. On the 20th day, it will reach the top of the well.

Note: I've reformatted the response to fit the requested format. Let me know if you need any further changes!

## Step 1: Understand the problem goal and current state
The problem goal is to find the domain of the function $k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}$. The current state is that the domain of the function is $(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (-\frac{1}{2}, \infty)$.

## Step 2: Analyze the function
The function $k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}$ will be undefined when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., when $2y+1=0$.

## Step 3: Solve for the value that makes the denominator zero
Solving the equation $2y+1=0$ gives $y=-\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 4: Determine the domain of the function
Since the function is undefined only at $y=-\frac{1}{2}$, the domain of the function is all real numbers except $-\frac{1}{2}$. This can be expressed in interval notation as $(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}) \"

### Problem Goal:
Find the value of $x$ such that $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 1} = 1$.

We can start by combining the fractions on the left-hand side.
$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x + 1} = \frac{(x + 1) + x}{x(x + 1)}$

## Step 1: Simplify the numerator of the combined fraction.
The numerator becomes $2x + 1$.

## Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the simplified numerator.
We can now rewrite the equation as $\frac{2x + 1}{x(x + 1)} = 1$.

## Step 3: Multiply both sides of the equation by $x(x + 1)$ to eliminate the fraction.
We get $2x + 1 = x(x + 1)$.

## Step 4: Expand the right-hand side of the equation.
We get $2x + 1 = x^2 + x$.

## Step 5: Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form.
We get $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$.

## Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation for $x$.
Using the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -1$.

## Step 7: Plug in the values into the quadratic formula.
We get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}$.

## Step 8: Simplify the expression inside the square root.
We get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2}$.

## Step 9: Further simplify the expression inside the square root.
We get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

## Step 10: Write the final solutions for $x$.
The solutions for $x$ are $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

We get $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)}$.

We get $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4}$.

## Proposed Solution
If the current state solves the problem, simply reiterate the current state value. Otherwise, propose one possible next step to solve the problem from the current state.

## Example

### Problem Goal
What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?

### Problem Goal
If $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional and $j = 16$ when $k = 21$, what is the value of $j$ when $k = 14$?

Please let me know if you want me to adjust anything. 

Here is the revised response:


## Step 1: Understand the problem goal
The problem goal is to find the number of revolutions a horse 16 feet from the center of a merry-go-round must make to travel the same distance as a horse 64 feet from the center, which makes 27 revolutions.

## Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the first horse
The distance traveled by the first horse can be calculated as the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of revolutions. The circumference of the circle is 2πr, where r is the radius. For the first horse, r = 64 feet. Therefore, the distance traveled by the first horse is 2π(64) * 27.

## Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled by the first horse in terms of the radius of the second horse
Since the distance traveled by the first horse is the same as the second horse, we can set up an equation: 2π(64) * 27 = 2π(r) * x, where x is the number of revolutions the second horse must make. We can simplify the equation by canceling out 2π: 64 * 27 = r * x.
