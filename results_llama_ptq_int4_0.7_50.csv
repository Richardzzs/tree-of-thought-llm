I'll provide the full problem and a possible next step for you to check.

## Step 1: Problem Goal
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$?

## Step 2: Current State
We need to rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form.

## Step 3: Possible next step
Subtract 10 from both sides of the inequality to get $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$.

## Step 4: Current State
Now we can factor the quadratic expression.

## Step 5: Possible next step
The quadratic expression can be factored as $(x-7)(x+2) \le 0$.

## Step 6: Current State
To solve this inequality, we need to find the intervals where the expression $(x-7)(x+2)$ is less than or equal to zero.

## Step 7: Possible next step
The solution set is the interval where one factor is negative and the other factor is positive, or both are zero."

Problem Goal:
The product of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $n!$ (n factorial). What is the value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 100?


$n!$ is divisible by 100 if $n!$ is divisible by both 4 and 25. The smallest $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 4 is 4, and the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 25 is 5.

## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 100.
## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the properties of factorials and divisibility.
## Step 3:  The first step is to identify the prime factors of 100, which are 2 and 5. We need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5.
## Step 4:  We know that $4!$ is divisible by 4 because it contains two factors of 2. Therefore, the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 4 is 4.
## Step 5:  Next, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 25. Since $25 = 5^2$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least two factors of 5.
## Step 6:  We observe that $5!$ contains two factors of 5, and"

Problem Goal:
If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a^2-b^2=100$ and $a^2+b^2=196$, what is the value of $a-b$?


Given $a^2-b^2=100$ and $a^2+b^2=196$, we can factor the left-hand side of the first equation as $(a+b)(a-b)=100$, and the left-hand side of the second equation as $(a+b)(a-b)=196$.
## Step 1:  From the given equations, we can see that $(a+b)(a-b)$ is a common factor in both equations.
## Step 2:  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $(a+b)$ and $(a-b)$ must be positive integers as well.
## Step 3:  Looking at the equation $(a+b)(a-b)=100$, we can try different factor pairs of 100 to find a solution that satisfies both equations.
## Step 4:  One factor pair of 100 that works is $(a+b)=10$ and $(a-b)=10$.
## Step 5:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=10$ and $(a-b)=10$, we find that $a=10$ and $b=0$.
## Step 6:  However, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=10$ and $b=0$ is not valid.
## Step 7:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$.
## Step 8:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$, we find that $a=12.5$ and $b=7.5$.
## Step 9:  Again, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=12.5$ and $b=7.5$ is not valid.
## Step 10:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=5$ and $(a-b)=20$.
## Step 11:  Solving the system of equations $(a+b)=5$ and $(a-b)=20$, we find that $a=12.5$ and $b=-12.5$.
## Step 12:  Again, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the solution $a=12.5$ and $b=-12.5$ is not valid.
## Step 13:  Let's try another factor pair of 100, which is $(a+b)=20$ and $(a-b)=5$.

Problem Goal:
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$. What is the measure of each angle in a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5?


We will use the law of cosines to find the angles.

## Step 1: Find the largest angle using the law of cosines
Using the law of cosines, we get $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)$. Let's assume the largest side is the hypotenuse, so we'll use $a=3$, $b=4$, and $c=5$ to find the largest angle $C$. Solving for $C$, we have $\cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}$.

## Step 2: Calculate the value of angle C
Plugging the values into the formula, we get $\cos(C) = \frac{3^2 + 4^2 - 5^2}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4} = \frac{9 + 16 - 25}{24} = 0$. The value of angle C is $\cos^{-1}(0) = 90^\circ$.

## Step 3: Find the other two angles
Since we know one angle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$ to find the other two angles. Let's denote the other two angles as A and B. We have $A + B + 90 = 180$, so $A + B = 90$.

## Step 4: Use the law of cosines to find the other two angles
We can use the law of cosines again to find the other two angles. For example, we can use $a=3$, $b=5$, and $c=4$ to find angle A. Solving for A, we have $\cos(A) = \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}$.

Since 27 = 3^3 and 9 = 3^2, we can rewrite the equation as (3^2)^(18n) = (3^3)^(24).

## Step 3: Simplify the equation further by applying the power rule
Using the power rule, we can rewrite the equation as 3^(36n) = 3^(72).

## Step 4: Equate the exponents
Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents, resulting in 36n = 72.

## Step 5: Solve for n

## Step 3: Find the value that makes the denominator zero
To find the value that makes the denominator zero, we set $2y+1=0$ and solve for $y$. This gives us $y=-\frac{1}{2}$.

Since log base 9 3 = 1/2, the equation can be simplified to 18n = 4. Solving for n, we get n = 4/9. However, the original problem statement is an equation of the form 9^x = 27^y. A more straightforward approach is to take the log base 9 of both sides and get x = 3y. Given that 9^x = 27^y, we can substitute 3 for x and y. Therefore, the value of n is 3. 
Note: The original solution to the problem is indeed n = 3, but the step-by-step derivation is not provided. This is because the problem has been solved and there is no need to take further steps.

Problem Goal:
Suppose that $f$ is an invertible function from $(-\infty,\infty)$ to $(-\infty,\infty)$.  If $f(f(x))=x$, find $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)$.


We can substitute $f(x)$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to get $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.

## Step 3: Let's consider the given expression $x_{n} = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(...f^{-1}(x)...f^{-n}(...x)...))$, where $x$ is repeated $n$ times.
Given the expression $x_{n} = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(...f^{-1}(x)...f^{-n}(...x)...))$, where $x$ is repeated $n$ times, we can see that this expression is a composition of $f^{-1}$ with itself $n$ times.

## Step 4: We can simplify the expression $x_{n}$ by realizing that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.
Since $f(f(x)) = x$, we can simplify the expression $x_{n}$ by realizing that $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) = x$. This means that $x_{n}$ is equivalent to $x$.

## Step 5: Now, we can substitute $x_{n} = x$ into the equation $y = f(x_{n})$.
Substituting $x_{n} = x$ into the equation $y = f(x_{n})$, we get $y = f(x)$.

## Step 6: Given that $f(f(x)) = x$, we can conclude that $f(x) = x + 1$.
Since $f(f(x)) = x$, we can conclude that $f(x) = x + 1$.

## Step 7: Now, we can find the value of $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n})$.
Using the fact that $x_{n} = x$ and $f(x) = x + 1$, we can find the value of $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n})$. Since $f(x) = x + 1$, we have $f(x_{n}) = x_{n} + 1$. Also, $f^{-1}(x) = x - 1$. Therefore, $f(x_{n}) - f^{-1}(x_{n}) = (x_{n} + 1) - (x_{n} - 1) = 2$.
