94,20,"The new ratio is 7:2, so the two numbers are 7x and 2x. The value of the lesser number is 2x = 2(4) = 8. The value of the larger number is 7x = 7(4) = 28.
The problem asks for the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it. The greater number is 28."
95,24,"Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $5=10x-3$.
Adding 3 to both sides gives $8=10x$.
Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x=\frac{8}{10}=\frac{4}{5}$.
The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$
Note that for this example, the current state is the solution to the problem, not a current state of the world. This example is more of a simple arithmetic problem.
Note that this is not the only possible next step, there are many possible next steps."

97,-7,"The equation $x^2 - x + \frac{5}{2} = 0$ is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. We can see that $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=\frac{5}{2}$. We can try to use the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, to solve for $x$.
The quadratic formula will give us two possible solutions for $x$. We can check to see if both solutions satisfy the original equation.
The solutions to the equation $x^2 - x + \frac{5}{2} = 0$ are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. Both solutions satisfy the original equation.
The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$"
